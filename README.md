# Frontend Mentor - Order summary card solution

This is a solution to the [Order summary card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

Since I am learning Javascript, I created some features to practice my knowledge

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

My personal improvements to the Frontend Mentor challenge:

- Change between dark and light mode
- Interact with the 'Change' button on the card to change the type of the plan (Annual Plan or Monthly Plan) and therefore see its price
  -Click on the 'Proceed to Payment' button and go to a checkout popUp where the user could enter their details and change the Billing cycle
  -Go back to the card by the 'Back' button

## Acknowledgments

I am thankful to @joseigor who helped me sometimes when I got stuck with Javascript, since this is my first project using this language.

Also, the dark/light mode I saw in a solution from @correlucas and I thought it very nice, so I wanted to try it too, by the way, his projects are very creative, something that I want to improve on my ones!
